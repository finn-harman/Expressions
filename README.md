# Expressions

In this project, I explore Java class hierarchy, including interfaces, abstract and concrete classes. I explore some more Java Standard Library classes and work with recursive methods. The class hierarchy that I build aims to provide functionality to operate using arithmetic expressions over natural numbers (i.e., positive integers).
